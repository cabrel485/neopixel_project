DESCRIPTION: D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another. In addition to interprocess communication, D-Bus helps coordinate process lifecycle; it makes it simple and reliable to code a \\"single instance\\" application or daemon, and to launch applications and daemons on demand when their services are needed.
